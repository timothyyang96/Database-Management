      "          \"articleBody\": \"Former President Bill Clinton is writing a new book about his post-presidential life, according to people familiar with the project, which was also confirmed by his spokesman.While Mr. Clinton has been out of public office for nearly two decades, he and Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, have remained fixtures on the national political scene. The former president’s standing was in decline during the 2018 midterm elections, however, with few Democrats seeking to campaign with him because of controversy over policies like the 1990s crime bill and his personal misconduct with women, which has come under a new spotlight because of the #MeToo movement.It is unclear how much of the book, if any, will deal with Mrs. Clinton’s two campaigns for president, or if Mr. Clinton will address the criticisms of his policy record or his personal behavior. He has mostly avoided those topics in his public appearances.Paul Bogaards, an executive vice president for the publisher, Knopf Doubleday, said there was still no timetable for publication and that while the book is about Mr. Clinton’s post-White House life it is still too “early to assess what ground will be covered.” Angel Ureña, Mr. Clinton’s press secretary, declined to comment on the contents of book.Mr. Clinton’s longtime attorney, Robert B. Barnett, negotiated the agreement with Knopf Doubleday. The sum was not disclosed.The book will be Mr. Clinton’s fifth since leaving the White House in 2001, including his best-selling autobiography, “My Life,” and most recently, his first best-selling novel, which was co-written with James Patterson (the title: “The President Is Missing”).The Clintons have remained public presences even since Mrs. Clinton’s surprise 2016 loss to President Trump. Mr. Clinton went on a book and media tour to promote his novel with Mr. Patterson, which included some discussions of the #MeToo movement.Mr. and Mrs. Clinton currently have plans for an 11-stop joint speaking tour that will continue in April in New York City.Their daughter, Chelsea Clinton, announced on Monday that she is pregnant with her third child, due later this summer.On a book tour of her own last fall, Ms. Clinton left open the possibility that she could run for political office herself someday, telling the local Westchester paper, “I think if someone were to step down or retire and I thought I could do a good job and it matched my talents, I’d have to think if it’s the right choice for me.”\",\n",

I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.]When supporters of Elizabeth Warren gathered on Capitol Hill today, they were ostensibly celebrating the Massachusetts senator’s swearing in to a second term.But it was hard to miss that crackle of presidential politics in the air. “The state of Warren nation is strong,” shouted a gleeful Senator Ed Markey, as he introduced Ms. Warren to her fans. “The chief is here.” Not long after, President Trump tweeted a meme featuring a “Warren 2020” sticker edited to mock her.Ms. Warren’s highly choreographed announcement on Monday that she is exploring a bid for president was the political version of firing a starting pistol for the 2020 Democratic primary. She is the highest-profile Democratic contender to have entered the race, with national poll numbers, substantial grass-roots support and a sizable donor network. She’s even headed to Iowa this weekend.Basically, it’s game on.But, honestly, at this point, there isn’t all that much of a game. Yes, more than three dozen candidates are considering running. And yes, as my colleague Alex Burns and I covered in the paper over the weekend, they’re interviewing staff, scouting headquarters and fleshing out financial plans.But almost no one is actually running — at least not yet. We’re still in that period of wild speculation. And with little visibly happening, political clichés like “likability” and “electability” are bound to appear out of the ether to fill the void.That’s part of what Ms. Warren discovered this week.Within hours of her tweet, she was “battling the ghosts of Hillary Clinton” to avoid being written off as unlikable. She was a “below par candidate,” based on the size of her Senate victory in deep blue Massachusetts, who faces real “electability” problems.It’s hard to see how these terms apply in the traditional sense in 2020. For the first time in 15 years, Democrats have an open field with no establishment favorite, so measuring electability is pretty difficult. And besides, being in the establishment may not be the asset it once was considered. At this point in 2015, Mrs. Clinton was seen as the most electable, even if she wasn’t likable — and we all know how that story ended.The Democratic pollster Margie Omero says terms like “likability” aren’t quite accurate in the Trump era. And you should forget about the old political chestnut that voters want “the guy they can have a beer with.”“Obviously, people want someone that they like,” says Ms. Omero. “But this sense that likability is the be-all and end-all of how voters view candidates is not really consistent with how we explore public opinion.”A better measure, she says, comes from tracking job approval, empathy and the sense voters have that a candidate will fight for people like them. “There are plenty of successful politicians out there who seem like they’re striving more to be tough fighters than huggy, baby-kissing kind of candidates,” says Ms. Omero.Ahem, President Trump. Senator Mitch McConnell. Senator Ted Cruz. Senator Bernie Sanders.You might notice that they’re all men. That’s not surprising.A whole body of academic research on “likability bias” shows it’s not enough for female leaders to be qualified — they have to be likable, too. Take Representative Nancy Pelosi, for example. For years, she’s been a top target of Republicans in attack ads, a situation her opponents often attribute to the fact that she’s a San Francisco liberal. But her equivalent in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, is a liberal from Brooklyn and far less targeted by Republicans.Or take those comparisons between Ms. Warren and the “ghosts of Hillary Clinton.” They’re both blond. They’re both grandmothers. They’re both female Democratic politicians. And they’re both lawyers. Other than that, it’s hard to see what, exactly, Ms. Warren and Ms. Clinton have in common.For her part, Ms. Warren largely refused to engage with issue of sexism or likability when I caught up with her on Capitol Hill today, dismissing the debate as a distraction. “I’m going to keep fighting on the issues because I think that’s what matters most,” she said.But her team saw some the value in the conversation: On Wednesday, they sent out a fund-raising email with the subject line “likability.”So, does this mean that if you don’t like Ms. Warren, you’re sexist? Obviously not. There are plenty of reasons for Democrats to decide that Ms. Warren shouldn’t be their nominee in 2020.But perhaps there needs to be a bit more specificity in the conversation when we talk about who we like and who we don’t — and what, exactly, that means.[Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox.]____________________On the HillIt was a big day in Congress, as overjoyed Democrats assumed control of the House and Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath of office to incoming senators. Even President Trump got in on the action, talking to reporters in a surprise first visit to the White House briefing room.The celebratory mood isn’t likely to last long. Overshadowing the day’s festivities was the political impasse over the government shutdown, which Senator Richard Shelby warned could go on for “months and months.”Nancy Pelosi was elected speaker. As expected, Ms. Pelosi returned to her post leading Congress, making it official that Democrats now control the House of Representatives. “Our nation is at a historic moment,” she said. “This Congress will be bipartisan, transparent and unified.”Not all Democrats supported her. Keeping with the pledges they made on the campaign trail, more than a dozen Democrats, mostly freshman, cast their speaker votes elsewhere — including one for Joe Biden and another for Stacy Abrams. (See the full list here.)The Senate was sworn in, too. On the other side of the Capitol, things were a little more subdued, as Mr. Pence swore in more than 30 new senators. That chamber remains in Republican control, 53 to 47.____________________Catching upWith winter break behind us, it’s time to snap out of our egg nog-induced haze and catch up on the stories we missed. Here are some of our favorites from the past couple weeks:• After nearly two years of assessing the accuracy of President Trump’s statements, The Times’s chief fact checker stepped back to look at the scale of the president’s mendacity, and how he uses inaccurate claims to advance his agenda, criticize the news media and celebrate his achievements. Read her conclusions here.• Black voters are keenly aware of the prominent role they will play in choosing the next presidential nominee. This time, they expect more than token attention from the candidates. Read the story.• The daughters of a foot doctor in Queens say that during the Vietnam War, their father came to a young Donald J. Trump’s aid with a diagnosis of bone spurs. The doctor’s landlords? The Trumps. “I know it was a favor,” said one daughter. Read our investigation.• When Mr. Trump made his first visit to a war zone last week, the trip was a tightly guarded secret. But there was one surprising source who cracked the mystery: a semiretired information technology specialist in England, looking out his kitchen window. Here’s how he figured it out.____________________What to read tonight• The most sensible response to the falling stock market? Doing nothing. At least that’s the advice of The Upshot.• A toddler in Afghanistan was the only member of her family to survive a roadside bomb. Their story travels down a road of poverty and loss in the war-torn country.•  “You must go to Iowa.” The irreplaceable Alexandra Petri takes on the 2020 guessing game. So much truth.____________________… SeriouslyThe best part of swearing-in day? A Congress crawling with the kids and grandkids of lawmakers.As Nancy Pelosi was sworn in as speaker, she called for the children in the chamber to join her, leading to a swarm of kids at the podium.ImageCreditCarolyn Kaster/Associated PressBut maybe the best moment of the day was when Representative Rashida Tlaib’s sons dabbed as she cast her vote for speaker.ImageCreditChip Somodevilla/Getty Images_____________________Were you forwarded this newsletter?

      "          \"articleBody\": \"President Trump said on Wednesday that he had “essentially” fired Defense Secretary Jim Mattis last month because he was dissatisfied with Mr. Mattis’s performance in the top civilian job at the Pentagon.His latest public criticism of Mr. Mattis, a retired Marine general, who resigned on Dec. 20 after failing to persuade Mr. Trump to change his mind about withdrawing the 2,000 American troops now in Syria, came at a time when the admiration Mr. Trump once regularly expressed for senior military officers has given way to anger at the retired officers who have questioned his character and condemned his performance in office now that they are civilians.Once Mr. Trump treated the military with a level of reverence that he extends to few other American institutions. Peppering his cabinet with retired senior officers enabled him to allay the concerns within the Republican Party about his own lack of experience and preparedness for the role of president. He has spoken admiringly of “my generals” and talked about those who looked the part.“They were like from a movie,” he said on Wednesday, describing a recent Pentagon briefing. “Better looking than Tom Cruise, and stronger.”But in the past few months, in ways big and small, some of the military’s most prominent figures, no longer inhibited by active duty, have spoken out against Mr. Trump in caustic terms, describing him as unfit for the presidency. And as in other situations where he has felt under attack, Mr. Trump has responded to criticism of his leadership by lashing out at his accusers.After the president pulled the security clearance of John O. Brennan, a former director of the C.I.A., the retired Adm. William H. McRaven, a Navy SEAL who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, wrote in The Washington Post that Mr. Trump has “embarrassed us in the eyes of our children.”Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who commanded American-led troops in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010, said recently that Mr. Trump does not “tell the truth,” and has urged Americans to decide how much they are willing to tolerate from the president.Gen. David H. Petraeus, a former director of the C.I.A., who was once seen as a potential administration official, recently said he would not work for Mr. Trump. And Gen. John F. Kelly, who stepped down this week as White House chief of staff, said in an exit interview that his tenure at the White House should be judged on what he prevented the president from doing.Over the holidays, amid criticism of this abrupt announcement of withdrawing American troops from Syria, Mr. Trump escalated his attacks, condemning the “failed generals” who had overseen Middle East engagements. He attacked Mr. McChrystal, who called Mr. Trump immoral in an appearance on ABC News over the weekend, writing on Twitter that he has a “big, dumb mouth” and is a “Hillary lover.” In a tweet weeks ago, he attacked Mr. McRaven for not killing bin Laden sooner.“I think that we can expect more of this in the future now that the line’s been crossed,” said Peter R. Mansoor, a retired Army colonel and a former aide to Mr. Petraeus, who is now a professor at Ohio State University. “I’m not sure it’s healthy for civil-military relations.”The risk, Colonel Mansoor said, is that “whether the criticism is deserved or not, future presidents may be less willing to trust their senior officers, thinking they’ll turn on them once they’re out of uniform, or they may be less willing to promote officers who are very competent but perhaps independently minded.”While Mr. Mattis’s resignation was the first over a major national security issue by a leading cabinet member since 1980, when Cyrus Vance quit as secretary of state, his conflict with Mr. Trump was hardly the first time that there have been clashes between civilian and military officials.In 2006, a number of retired military officers publicly rebuked Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld for his handling of the Iraq war. In 1993, President Bill Clinton was at odds with military officials over allowing gay men and lesbians in the military. And there was a hefty amount of distrust between President Barack Obama and military officials over the administration’s approach to Iraq and Afghanistan.During the 2016 presidential campaign, Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, led chants of “Lock her up!” about Hillary Clinton at the Republican National Convention, while John R. Allen, a retired Marine general, as a speaker at the Democratic National Convention, questioned Mr. Trump’s ability to be the commander in chief.But Peter Feaver, a former National Security Council official under Mr. Clinton and President George W. Bush who now teaches political science at Duke University, said Mr. Trump has taken these clashes to a new level.“We’ve never had a president who was as insensitive to the norms and taboos” of the military, Mr. Feaver said. “People like McChrystal, people like McRaven and the others are responding to the president’s breaking of these taboos.”“No American president has ever dared risk the American civil-military relationship for less cause or with such childish malice,” Tom Nichols, a professor at the Naval War College, wrote in The Atlantic after the McChrystal tweets.In tweets of his own, Mr. McRaven defended Mr. McChrystal from Mr. Trump’s attacks.“Stan McChrystal is one of the great generals of this generation and the finest officer I ever served with. He is a deep strategic thinker, tactically brilliant, with unparalleled personal courage. His leadership of special operations forces in Iraq and Afghanistan,” he wrote, “unquestionably saved the lives of thousands of American and allied troops, as well as countless civilians. No general I know has given more in the service of this country.”Mr. Trump’s public criticism of Mr. Mattis, who was long considered “the adult” in the president’s cabinet, was apparently provoked by his letter of resignation, in which Mr. Mattis outlined his own views about the value of alliances and wrote that the president was entitled to have a defense secretary whose views were “better aligned with yours.”Mr. Mattis had originally said he planned to remain at the Pentagon through February to allow for an orderly transition. But after his letter received intense media coverage, Mr. Trump abruptly ordered him to leave the job as of Jan. 1.“What’s he done for me? How has he done in Afghanistan? Not too good,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday at a cabinet meeting that turned into an extended question-and-answer session with reporters. “I’m not happy with what he’s done in Afghanistan, and I shouldn’t be happy.”“As you know, President Obama fired him, and essentially so did I,” the president said, referring to the fact that Mr. Mattis served as commander of the military’s Central Command under Mr. Obama, but retired a few months earlier than expected in 2013 after repeatedly clashing with Mr. Obama’s national security team over policy in the region, especially regarding Iran.Mr. Trump then praised himself for providing money for soldiers in Afghanistan, and said that Mr. Mattis was “thrilled” when it happened.He also said that he thought he himself “would’ve been a good general,” adding, “but who knows.”\",\n",

      "          \"articleBody\": \"WASHINGTON — The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, revealed on Friday the most direct link yet between parallel efforts by the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election using Democratic Party material stolen by Russians.A top Trump campaign official dispatched Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to President Trump, to get information from WikiLeaks about the thousands of hacked Democratic emails, according to an indictment. The effort began weeks after Democratic officials publicly accused Russian intelligence operatives of the theft, which was part of Moscow’s broad campaign to sabotage the 2016 presidential race.The indictment made no mention of whether Mr. Trump played a role in the coordination, though Mr. Mueller did leave a curious clue about how high in the campaign the effort reached: A senior campaign official “was directed” by an unnamed person to contact Mr. Stone about additional WikiLeaks releases that might damage the Clinton campaign, according to the court document.In an indictment filled with colorful details about clandestine meetings, angry texts — even a reference to “The Godfather: Part II” — Mr. Stone was charged with seven counts, including obstruction, making false statements and witness tampering. Mr. Mueller did not say that Mr. Stone’s interactions with WikiLeaks were illegal, nor that the Trump campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the organization.[Read the indictment.]F.B.I. agents arrested Mr. Stone before dawn, appearing at his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., home with ballistic vests and guns drawn. Agents typically use those tactics as a precaution to secure possible evidence and protect themselves in case a suspect fights arrest. Prosecutors sealed details of the case because they feared that public disclosure would increase the risk of Mr. Stone fleeing or destroying or tampering with evidence, according to court documents.How Stone is Connected to WikiLeaks and President Trump\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t#g-stone-diagram-box {\\n\\t\\tmax-width:720px;\\n\\t}\\n\\t#g-stone-diagram-box .g-artboard {\\n\\t\\tmargin:0

A man known for his dapper wardrobe was dressed simply in a navy blue cotton polo shirt, bluejeans and his trademark round, black-rimmed glasses.[Read more about Roger Stone, a self-described dirty trickster.]Afterward, in a theatrical appearance outside the courthouse, Mr. Stone vowed to beat what he called politically motivated charges. “There is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies to ease the pressure on myself,” he said.“I look forward to being fully and completely vindicated,” he added, then flashed twin V-for-victory hand signs reminiscent of his political hero, former President Richard M. Nixon. In a brief interview later, Mr. Stone said he will plead not guilty, and people close to him have predicted that Mr. Trump could pardon Mr. Stone should he be convicted of any of the charges.[Transcript: Read Mr. Stone’s statement responding to his arrest.] The indictment is the first in months by Mr. Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination with Trump associates. Citing details in emails and other forms of communications, the indictment suggested that Mr. Trump’s campaign knew about additional stolen emails before they were released and asked Mr. Stone to find out about them.According to the indictment, between June and July 2016, Mr. Stone told “senior Trump campaign officials” about the stolen emails in WikiLeaks’ possession that could be damaging to Mrs. Clinton. On July 22 that year, WikiLeaks released its first batch of Democratic emails. After that, according to the indictment, the Trump campaign sought more.ImageA portion of the indictment.“A senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton campaign,” the indictment said, referring to WikiLeaks.The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, sought to broadly distance Mr. Trump from the charges. “The charges brought against Mr. Stone have nothing to do with the president,” she told CNN. Asked whether he directed a campaign aide to contact Mr. Stone about the WikiLeaks emails, she repeated that the charges did not involve Mr. Trump.A self-described dirty trickster, Mr. Stone began his career as a Nixon campaign aide and has a tattoo of Nixon on his back. He has spent decades plying the political dark arts — including scandal-mongering — to help influence American election campaigns, and has long maintained that he had no connection to Russia’s attempts to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.He sometimes seemed to taunt American law enforcement agencies, daring them to find hard evidence to link him to Moscow’s interference; it is illegal for a political campaign to accept foreign aid. His brash behavior made him less of a subject of news media scrutiny than other current and former aides to President Trump — like the character in a whodunit whom readers immediately dismiss as too obvious to have committed the crime.The indictment does not mention whether Mr. Stone or any other Trump associate knew about the Russian operatives’ plans before they hacked the Democrats.In social media posts and interviews during the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Stone indicated that he had advance knowledge that a trove of information damaging to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign might be about to spill into public view, and even suggested that he had personally spoken to the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange.VideoRoger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to President Trump, said he has been falsely accused and “will plead not guilty.” He also called the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, “politically motivated.”CreditCreditCristobal Herrera/EPA, via ShutterstockMr. Stone has changed his story as investigators closed in, saying that he was not actually speaking to Mr. Assange and that he had no direct knowledge that Russians were responsible for the Democratic hacking. Still, it was revealed last year that, in the weeks before the election, Mr. Stone was messaging on Twitter with Guccifer 2.0, a pseudonym used by one or more operatives in the Russian intelligence scheme to steal the emails and funnel them to WikiLeaks.Three senior Trump campaign officials told Mr. Mueller’s team that Mr. Stone created the impression that he was a conduit for inside information from WikiLeaks, according to people familiar with their witness interviews. One of them told investigators that Mr. Stone not only seemed to predict WikiLeaks’ actions, but also that he took credit afterward for the timing of its disclosures that damaged Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy.In October 2016, Mr. Stone exchanged emails with Stephen K. Bannon, then the chief executive of Mr. Trump’s campaign. In one exchange, Mr. Stone wrote that more WikiLeaks disclosures were forthcoming, “a load every week going forward,” according to the indictment. Mr. Bannon appears to be the official described in the court document as “the high-ranking Trump Campaign official,” based on previous disclosures about the email exchange.Tuesday, October 4, 2016FROM: Steve Bannon TO: Roger StoneEMAIL: What was that this morning???Tuesday, October 4, 2016 FROM: Roger StoneTO: Steve BannonEMAIL: Fear.

Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign. The release, 30 minutes after The Washington Post published a recording of Mr. Trump bragging about assaulting women, appeared aimed at redirecting negative attention from Mr. Trump to the Clinton campaign.The special counsel’s investigators spent months encircling Mr. Stone, and the indictment unsealed on Friday detailed how he relied on several longtime associates to get information about the timing and content of WikiLeaks’ document releases in the months before the election.Everyone Who’s Been Charged in Investigations Related to the 2016 ElectionSix Trump advisers or officials have been charged by the special counsel.They pored over his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The indictment documented numerous lies to lawmakers about his efforts to set up a back channel to WikiLeaks, and about his efforts to pressure other witnesses to lie.ImageListen to ‘The Daily’: The Story of Roger Stone and WikiLeaksThe special counsel’s indictment of the longtime Trump adviser establishes a direct connection between WikiLeaks and the president’s campaign.transcriptBack to The Dailybars0:00/24:25-24:25transcriptListen to ‘The Daily’: The Story of Roger Stone and WikiLeaksHosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Theo Balcomb, Paige Cowett, Jonathan Wolfe and Alexandra Leigh Young, and edited by Lisa TobinThe special counsel’s indictment of the longtime Trump adviser establishes a direct connection between WikiLeaks and the president’s campaign.michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today: The special counsel’s indictment of Roger Stone contains details as over-the-top as Stone himself, including encouraging an associate to use a tactic straight from “The Godfather” films. But the indictment itself is quite serious in finally making a link between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks. It’s Monday, January 28. [POUNDING ON DOOR]archived recordingF.B.I.! Open the door!archived recording (roger stone)Twenty-nine F.B.I. agents showed up at my home, pounded on the door. [POUNDING ON DOOR]archived recordingF.B.I.!archived recording (roger stone)I opened the door to pointed automatic weapons. I was handcuffed. There were —archived recordingWe have some major breaking news in the Mueller investigation. Roger Stone — you see him right there — President Trump’s longtime political adviser, former campaign aide, has been arrested in Florida. Charged with seven federal felonies, obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of making false statements and one count of witness tampering.archived recording (sarah huckabee sanders)This has nothing to do with the president, has nothing to do with the White House, and beyond that, I’m not going to get into the back and forth.archived recordingHave you spoken to the president?archived recording (roger stone)There is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies to ease the pressure on myself. I look forward to being fully and completely vindicated.michael barbaroSo, Mark Mazzetti, what do we need to know about who Roger Stone is?mark mazzettiRoger Stone is a legendary Republican operative who, from the earliest days of his career, has plied the dark arts of scandal-mongering and dirty tricks in aid of political campaigns.archived recordingAre you telling me that that was a lie? Roger Stone is a trickster. Roger Stone is a shady character, O.K.? I know Roger Stone, and you know, he worked for Nixon. He famously tattooed his hero on his back. And who among us can say that? The questionable consultant’s resume is filled with work for Republican stars — Nixon, Reagan, Bush senior.mark mazzettiHe is someone who very proudly talks about how he tries to plant stories with the press, someone who tries to dig up any kind of personal dirt about a candidate in order to help the other side.archived recording (roger stone)I’m certainly guilty of bluffing and posturing and punking the Democrats. Unless they pass some law against bull-bull-[BLEEP]-ing-ing and I missed it, I’m engaging in tradecraft. It’s politics. I’m sure it’s driving the Democrats crazy, but there’s nothing illegal about it.mark mazzettiSo this is someone who — well, for many people who hate politics, they would hate someone like Roger Stone.archived recording (roger stone)The truth is, Jimmy Carter’s middle name was not Hussein. A very substantial number of people wonder, because of the policies of this administration, about whether the president is a Muslim. This is not going to hurt Trump, and it’s not going to hurt Carson.archived recordingThey may wonder, but should a presidential candidate like Trump be saying that, or at least condoning it with his silence?archived recording (roger stone)I don’t think he commented either way.mark mazzettiHe goes on television in strange outfits, he gives interviews from his pool and clearly, in many cases, doesn’t take himself too seriously.michael barbaroSo he’s kind of a sideshow.mark mazzettiExcept he’s someone who Donald Trump has taken seriously for a long time.archived recording (roger stone)He’s a regular guy. You can talk to him like a regular person. There’s nothing formal or stilted about him, and he’s funny. He’s got a great self-deprecating wit. He’s just fun to be with.mark mazzettiHe’s been this sort of informal adviser to Trump over decades, and someone who, long, long before anyone took seriously the idea of Donald Trump being the president of the United States, Roger Stone was pushing this idea.archived recording (roger stone)It was not until 1987, really, late ‘87, that I began thinking about him as a presidential candidate.mark mazzettiAlthough it has often been a contentious relationship.archived recording (roger stone)Yeah, I think we have a complicated relationship. But first of all, recognize, I’m a Trump loyalist. Even when he’s wrong, I’ll be there.mark mazzettiThey’ve been at odds at times. He’s someone who didn’t last very long on the Trump campaign. He started out as an official campaign adviser, but was fired from the campaign pretty quickly.archived recordingAnd more turmoil for Trump — a top longtime associate both from his business world and in the political realm, Roger Stone is out tonight. Dispute about whether he resigned or was fired. Trump’s campaign says Stone was fired because he was using the campaign to seek publicity for himself.archived recording (roger stone)I have no interest in going back. Although I strongly support Trump, we have managerial differences. And meanwhile, I’m just making the very best case for him in public that I can, because I do think he has what it takes.michael barbaroAnd insofar as he was involved in the campaign, what exactly was his role as an informal adviser? What did that amount to?mark mazzettiHe was the classic late-night phone call person to listen to what Trump was thinking. He was the confidant of then-candidate Trump, talking to him by phone, being a sort of back channel of advice outside official campaign communications. You didn’t always know that Roger Stone was there, because he did have this behind-the-scenes role. But it was pretty apparent to people close to Trump that Roger Stone had this outsized influence over Trump.archived recordingIt seems to me there’s more than meets the eye here with Roger Stone parting company from the Trump campaign, coming on my program and others and giving the big Trump pitch.archived recording (roger stone)You media types are so conspiratorial. [LAUGHTER]archived recordingNo, no, the Stone-Trump types I think are the conspiratorial.archived recording (roger stone)I’m like —mark mazzettiSo he was behind the scenes until he wasn’t. In August of 2016, a few months before the election, Roger Stone sent a very cryptic tweet about Podesta.archived recordingRoger Stone tweeted that it would soon be, quote, “Podesta’s time in the barrel.”mark mazzettiAnd he said it will soon be his time in the barrel. Now Podesta was John Podesta, the campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton. And no one really knew what that meant until a few months later in October. A few weeks before the election, he sent out another tweet. I think it said, “On Wednesday, Hillary Clinton is done. #WikiLeaks.”archived recordingRoger Stone writes, “Thursday, October 6, Julian Assange will deliver a devastating expose on Hillary at a time of his choosing. I stand by my prediction. #HandcuffsForHillary.”mark mazzettiAnd then —archived recordingWe need to talk about these hacked emails.mark mazzettiThe Podesta emails spill out a few days later.archived recordingWikiLeaks released more than 2,000 emails. They claim they came from her campaign chairman, John Podesta, and other staffers. The leak revealed transcripts from some of Clinton’s paid Wall Street speeches. This is the first time that we’re actually getting a look at these Wall Street speeches. What you see is that her own words really hit on her own perceived weaknesses, particularly around relatability and trust. You see why she really wasn’t in a hurry to release these, as it really highlights a lot of concerns that voters have about her.mark mazzettiAnd so this is again Roger Stone creating this image that he had a direct channel to WikiLeaks and knew what the information was going to be before it became public.michael barbaroRight. And if I remember correctly, one of those WikiLeaks dumps of emails was right around the time of the “Access Hollywood” tape being published.archived recording (john podesta)October 7, the “Access Hollywood” tape comes out. One hour later, WikiLeaks starts dropping my emails into the public. One could say that those things might not have been a coincidence.michael barbaroWhich was interesting timing.mark mazzettiWithin hours. And of course, that’s very fortuitous timing if you’re candidate Trump. Very quickly, a lot of the media started focusing on the Podesta emails rather than this explosive story about the “Access Hollywood” tape.michael barbaroSo at this point, justifiably, everyone is starting to wonder, does Roger Stone, this informal adviser to the president who is in touch with the campaign, does he have inside knowledge of what’s going on at WikiLeaks? Is he coordinating with this organization?mark mazzettiYes, and remember, Roger Stone has built a career on creating an image that he does have great access.archived recording (roger stone)I actually have communicated with Assange. I believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation.mark mazzettiHe does have insight that others don’t.archived recording (roger stone)I think that Assange is going to be very influential in this election, because he’s going to be educating the American people about the Clintons.mark mazzettiOnce the Russia investigation heats up, though, he has to reverse course.archived recording (roger stone)I had no advance notice of the content source or the exact disclosure time of the WikiLeaks disclosures. Assange himself has said so. In fact, Assange has said in his own tweets and in interviews that Roger Stone never predicted anything that I hadn’t already said in public.mark mazzettiHe has to paint himself as someone who didn’t have that knowledge, who didn’t have any insight, because that was something that could potentially put him in real legal jeopardy.michael barbaroSo what do we learn from this indictment last week about what was really going on here?mark mazzettiSo what we learned on Friday is that Roger Stone in fact did have insights into what WikiLeaks was doing. He made extensive efforts to find out what Julian Assange was planning. And we find out that he was directed by people inside the campaign to go find out what WikiLeaks was doing. So we really, for the first time, have a sense that there was a link between WikiLeaks’s efforts to damage Hillary Clinton and the Trump campaign’s efforts to damage Hillary Clinton. And that link was Roger Stone. And something else that should not be lost in all this is that all of this was happening months after it was first revealed that the Russian government was behind this operation to hack the Democratic servers and put the information out for WikiLeaks.michael barbaroAnd that’s significant because it’s one thing to be coordinating with WikiLeaks when no one quite knows how it got those internal Clinton emails. It’s another to be coordinating with WikiLeaks once it’s understood that the emails it’s disseminating were stolen by Russia. It seems to elevate this above wanting negative information about your opponent out in the world.mark mazzettiThat’s right. All of this was done while it was well known that the Russians were behind this operation.michael barbaroSo do we know who on the campaign was talking to Roger Stone and encouraging him to keep communicating with WikiLeaks and find out when their leaks would occur?mark mazzettiThat’s where it becomes really interesting. The Times reported a few months ago that Steve Bannon, who was the campaign chairman at the end, was in contact with Roger Stone about this. In early October, Stone writes Steve Bannon that WikiLeaks would release, quote, “a load every week going forward.” He separately writes to a supporter involved in the Trump campaign, quote, “spoke to my friend in London last night. The payload is still coming.”michael barbaroFriend in London presumably meaning Julian Assange?mark mazzettiRight. But the Mueller indictment has a very tantalizing detail.michael barbaroWhat’s that?mark mazzettiThe indictment said that a senior campaign official, quote, was directed by someone to contact Stone about additional WikiLeaks releases. There’s a very odd use of the passive voice that you would not expect in an indictment written by lawyers with Ivy League educations. The indictment does not say who it was that directed the senior campaign official. Of course, it’s led to speculation that that person could only be Donald Trump. We don’t know.michael barbaroEverything you’re describing here about Roger Stone’s communications with the campaign and Roger Stone’s communications with WikiLeaks — it sounds quite nefarious, but I wonder if it is illegal. Is his communication with WikiLeaks what Roger Stone was indicted for?mark mazzettiNo. The charge is Stone lying to Congress about his interactions with WikiLeaks, trying to tamper with witness testimony and an overall charge of obstruction of justice. As for the witness tampering charge, that centers around Stone’s interactions with someone named Randy Credico, who is a longtime New York radio personality, on-again-off-again friend of Stone, and someone who did in fact seem to have direct connections to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. And what the indictment details is that Roger Stone had several communications with Credico, trying to make sure that Credico told the same story to the House that Roger Stone had told, and even suggesting that he should pull a, quote, “Frank Pentangeli” before the committee.archived recordingDid you serve on the capital regime, Peter Clemenza, under Vito Corleone, also known as “the godfather“?mark mazzettiAnd that is a reference to a character in “The Godfather 2” who is called before Congress to testify about the mob and all of a sudden gets amnesia.archived recordingI ask you again, sir, here and now, under oath, were you at any time a member of a crime organization headed by Michael Corleone? I don’t know nothing about that! Oh. I was in the olive oil business with his father, but that was a long time ago. That’s all.michael barbaroAnd why isn’t Mueller going after Stone for anything other than the lying, for the actions he lied about?mark mazzettiIt’s hard to make a conspiracy case. The fact is that the emails appear to have been stolen before Roger Stone knew about them, so he didn’t seem to have participated in the theft. And he seemed to maybe be trafficking in information that was becoming public or was about to be public. And this is what his defenders and the president’s defenders have pointed out, that these are all crimes that happened after the fact. He is not being charged with something that’s at the bottom of this whole thing — collusion, conspiracy, et cetera. And this is what, of course, President Trump has fallen back on for some time.archived recordingThis is why this thing is so weird, strange. The crime is conspiracy to hack. Collusion is not a crime. It doesn’t exist. Now, conspiracy to defraud the government — you’re right. Conspiracy to hack, that is the crime. We don’t know whether — Now, did Donald Trump engage in a conspiracy to hack with the Russians? They’ve been going at it — the counterintelligence investigation came to the conclusion — no evidence.michael barbaroMark, it feels like time and time again, when it comes to the Mueller investigation, he and his prosecutors are charging people around the president with lying or tampering with a witness or doing something deceptive around their interactions with his own investigation, but not with actually colluding with Russia or coordinating with Russia or being involved in a conspiracy that involves Russia, which, of course, is what this investigation is really about. What do you make of that?mark mazzettiIf you want to look at it as a best-case scenario for President Trump, it’s that there’s no original crime here. There’s no collusion, there’s no conspiracy. They’ve been charged because they were just lying to Congress.archived recordingToday’s surprise guilty plea by Michael Cohen — Cohen said in federal court that he lied to Congress, he says, to support Mr. Trump’s timeline of a Moscow real estate deal.mark mazzettiLying to the F.B.I. Withholding evidence.archived recordingTonight, former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos admitting he lied to the F.B.I. about his contacts with someone the F.B.I. suspected of being a Russian operative to cover for President Trump.mark mazzettiBut the worst-case scenario is that they are lying to protect something big. They were so concerned about what’s at the bottom of this story that they had to lie to keep investigators from getting there. That’s been one of the enduring mysteries of this entire story. Was there a grand conspiracy, or does this all add up to small, individual acts, individual contacts with Russians, individual business deals gone bad that individual people were trying to lie to cover up their own role? The fact that we don’t know where Mueller is going and Mueller only reveals his strategy in individual indictments means that we’re still left with these kinds of questions.michael barbaroAnd in this latest indictment, we’ve learned that Roger Stone, who has not been taken very seriously all this time, now seems to represent something quite important in all of this.mark mazzettiYes. In many ways, Roger Stone was this kind of cartoonish figure. If this were a whodunit, he’d be the obvious suspect that a reader would have long ago dismissed because he’s too obvious. And yet, here’s Roger Stone being charged with very serious crimes. And for the first time, we see Mueller show his hand that there really was this direct link between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks. But I think the bigger point is the question of how directly the Trump campaign officials were working with the original source of the information, and that is the Russian government. WikiLeaks was a pass-through here. The Russian government, Russian hackers gave it to WikiLeaks to distribute. The real question at the end of the day is not the communications necessarily with WikiLeaks, but whether there was foreknowledge about what Russia was doing and any direct communication with the Russians about their campaign to sabotage Hillary Clinton’s political future.michael barbaroMark, thank you very much.mark mazzettiThank you.michael barbaroWe’ll be right back.archived recording (president trump)Thank you very much. My fellow Americans, I am very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government. [APPLAUSE]michael barbaroOn Friday afternoon, just hours after the F.B.I. raid of Roger Stone’s home, President Trump walked into the Rose Garden of the White House and announced victoriously that he was temporarily ending the shutdown with no agreement from the Democrats to fund his border wall.archived recording (president trump)I want to thank all of the incredible federal workers and their amazing families —michael barbaroThe announcement came a day after two bills to reopen the government — one sponsored by Republicans, the other by Democrats — failed to pass in the Senate, and as frustration over the shutdown began to boil over in highly public and disruptive ways.archived recordingThey’re both clowns. Both sides should sit down and make it happen, including our president, including Pelosi. It’s ridiculous. It’s not fair. It’s not T.S.A.‘s fault that they’re not getting paid and stuff. It’s the government’s fault. So the government should get it together.michael barbaroBy Friday, so many air traffic controllers had called in sick that the Federal Aviation Administration grounded flights across the Northeast. Hundreds of workers at the IRS refused to show up for work, and the director of the F.B.I., Christopher Wray, had released a public message to his employees.archived recording (christopher wray)Hi, everyone. We’re now five weeks and two missed paychecks into this mess, and I wanted to touch base with all of you again. Making some people stay home when they don’t want to and making others show up without pay — it’s mind-boggling, it’s short-sighted and it’s unfair. It takes a lot to get me angry, but I’m about as angry as I’ve been in a long, long time.michael barbaroUnity among congressional Republicans, which had held for a month, began to collapse, with Republican senators, including majority leader Mitch McConnell, telling Vice President Mike Pence that the president’s shutdown strategy was not working and needed to end immediately. In his speech, the president, who has made the $5.7 billion in funding for his wall a non-negotiable condition for ending the shutdown, and who repeatedly rejected Democratic proposals to reopen the government while negotiations continue, ultimately did just that, restoring government to normal function for the next three weeks and promising to quickly pay back federal workers who have missed paychecks since the shutdown began. But —archived recording (president trump)If we don’t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on February 15 again, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the Constitution of the United States to address this emergency.michael barbaroDemocrats and Republicans will enter formal negotiations this week to see if they can find a compromise on border security funding and on what constitutes a wall, a definition that is evolving for the president himself.archived recording (president trump)We do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea. We never did. We never proposed that. We never wanted that, because we have barriers at the border where natural structures are as good as anything that we can build. They’re already there. They’ve been there for millions of years.michael barbaroThat change in language and the decision to reopen the government with no funding for the wall drew condemnation from conservatives like Ann Coulter, who many believe helped push the president into a shutdown in the first place. “Good news for George Herbert Walker Bush,” Coulter wrote on Twitter. “As of today, he is no longer the biggest wimp to ever serve as president of the United States.” That’s it for The Daily. I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.He exchanged heated texts with Randy Credico, a New York radio host with his own contacts with WikiLeaks, pressuring Mr. Credico to lie to the Intelligence Committee so that his story would line up with Mr. Stone’s.Mr. Stone told Mr. Credico he should “do a ‘Frank Pentangeli’” before the House committee, the indictment said, a reference to a “Godfather” character who lies to Congress about his interactions with the Mafia.The tumultuous relationship between Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump goes back decades, with Mr. Stone serving as an informal adviser as Mr. Trump considered running for president several times.When Mr. Trump formally announced during the spring of 2015 that he was running for president, Mr. Stone was one of the first to join his campaign. Within months, however, the two had a public dispute and Mr. Stone left the team. But they have remained close, speaking often by telephone.On Friday, the day that Mr. Stone stood on the steps of a courthouse and pledged his enduring loyalty to the president, Mr. Trump bashed the investigation that had led armed federal agents to his friend’s house in the morning darkness.“Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country!” he wrote on Twitter. “NO COLLUSION!”\",\n",

      "          \"articleBody\": \"Joyce Cusack would love to see a woman as president in her lifetime. But she is not sure it should happen in 2020.“Are we ready in 2020? I really don’t think we are,” said Ms. Cusack, 75, a former Democratic National Committee member from Florida. Too many Americans may not want to “take another chance” on a female candidate, Ms. Cusack said, after Hillary Clinton was met with mistrust and even hostility in swing states.But Andy McGuire, the former chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party, sees a different reality after a record number of Democratic women won races in the 2018 midterms. “I’d go back to this last election — who won?” said Dr. McGuire, who, as a superdelegate like Ms. Cusack, supported Mrs. Clinton at the 2016 convention. “Who had the excitement? Who had all the volunteers and power behind them? It was women.”As the 2020 primary competition gets underway with Elizabeth Warren’s entry into the race, and with several other women likely to be early contenders, two competing narratives have emerged about the possibility of another woman leading the Democratic ticket, interviews with more than three dozen party officials, voters and pollsters showed.The year of the woman and the midterm gains that followed electrified Democrats, who have eagerly promoted themselves as the party of diversity. That success has inspired some of the most powerful women in politics to consider running for president. And it has boosted expectations that the political calculus for women has changed in the last two years, and that gender could become an asset, even in a presidential contest. Mrs. Clinton, after all, won the popular vote by almost three million.Yet at a time of ascendancy for women in the party, there’s a lingering doubt in some quarters about whether there is a risk involved in nominating a woman to take on President Trump, whom Democrats fervently want to unseat.The specter of Mrs. Clinton’s defeat in 2016 still haunts some Democratic officials, voters and activists. There is widespread recognition that women in politics are held to a different standard than men on qualities like likability and toughness, and that voters have traditionally been more reluctant to elect women as executives than as legislators.Some women see bias in the excitement surrounding a potential presidential run by Beto O’Rourke, the Texan who energized the left in a losing Senate bid, while Stacey Abrams is not mentioned as a possibility even though she had a much narrower loss for governor of Georgia.“There’s a real tension,” said Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress and a former policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton. “On one hand, women are leading the resistance and deserve representation. But on the other side, there’s a fear that if misogyny beat Clinton, it can beat other women.”Much of the debate is grounded in the question of whether Mrs. Clinton’s loss represented a rejection of women as president, or of one specific woman. How significant a role sexism played in Mrs. Clinton’s defeat is difficult to separate from the other liabilities that hindered her campaign. Mrs. Clinton struggled to deal with decades of political baggage and a Republican attack machine that cast her as aloof, elitist and disconnected. Her reliance on a tight-knit inner circle isolated her from tough political challenges, and she struggled to win over working-class white women and men.ImageElizabeth Warren speakng in Iowa Friday night. A field that includes multiple female candidates is expected to contend for the Democratic presidential nomination.CreditGabriella Demczuk for The New York TimesIf Democrats nominate a woman in 2020, she will most likely face an onslaught of gender-based attacks from Mr. Trump, who did not hesitate in 2016 to mock the physical appearance and stamina of his female opponents. As the Republican nominee, Mr. Trump carried more vulnerabilities on gender than any other modern candidate, facing allegations of sexual assault and harassment and having a record of lewd comments about women.Still, exit polls indicated that a majority of white women voted for Mr. Trump, helping him seal crucial Electoral College victories in traditionally Democratic states like Pennsylvania and Michigan.As Democrats look toward 2020, the conversation is particularly relevant because the 2020 primary season could prove to be as historic as the 2008 and 2016 races; in those years, Mrs. Clinton became the first woman to become a top-tier candidate and then a nominee.For the first time, multiple women may be serious contenders: Senator Warren is in, and Senators Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are seriously considering running. A female front-runner would become a norm if a woman wins the nomination four years after Mrs. Clinton did.Women’s political mobilization — as volunteers, candidates and donors — fueled the Democratic Party’s gains in the November elections, and Democrats still far outpace Republicans in elevating women to party leadership and representation in Congress. Female politicians now head all four of the Democrats’ campaign committees.Regardless of whether a woman wins the nomination, the presence of new, multiple female faces in the race could help the party move past a set of political expectations for women largely defined by Mrs. Clinton for decades. Already, comparisons to Mrs. Clinton have been unavoidable for the female 2020 contenders, even though they have little in common other than their gender and party.“It is very hard, when you only have that one woman who’s tread that ground,” said Ilyse Hogue, the president of the abortion-rights organization Naral. “Everything about that individual becomes conflated with being a woman.”The rawness of the topic was evident in the furor that broke out this week over Ms. Warren’s relatively low likability ratings. Research has found that it is much harder for female candidates to be rated as “likable” than men — and that they are disproportionately punished for traits voters accept in male politicians, including ambition and aggression. “Likability is totally framed by gender,” said Celinda Lake, a longtime Democratic pollster and expert on women’s votes.Pushing back, Ms. Warren tweeted a video of herself on a train with the acid comment: “I hear women candidates are most likable in the quiet car!”Yet for others, Mrs. Clinton’s loss sounded some notes of caution.“During the campaign, I was shocked over and over and over again to see the type of attacks toward very strong, knowledgeable women,” said Isabel Farmer, a superdelegate from Ohio who received phone threats after backing Mrs. Clinton in 2016. “Maybe I’m still traumatized by that.’’Some voters acknowledged the higher standard applied to female candidates but said that was not a reason to abandon the pursuit of the White House.Image&ldquo;Could a woman win? Yes, and it&rsquo;s high time,&rdquo; said Patricia McAuley of Wyomissing, Pa.CreditHannah Yoon for The New York Times“I think right now there’s still not going to be a female president, unfortunately,” said Jessica Nusbaum, of Wrightsville, Pa., as she walked through a mall in suburban Philadelphia. “Right now I think we kind of — not regressed, but looked to the past.” But she added, “Women should still run, even if they keep failing.”Patricia McAuley, a Democrat from Wyomissing, Pa., agreed. “I do believe they’re held to a different standard,” she said, adding: “But could a woman win? Yes, and it’s high time.”To those still reeling from the 2016 loss, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, had a blunt message: “Get over it and use 2017 and 2018 as the evidence that the pathogen has left the body.”Rather than a liability, several Democrats believe that having women run could be a galvanizing force in the presidential race, as it was in the midterms, when female candidates changed the playbook for how women run for office. Many campaigned with their young children and made their personal stories central to their message. They were not afraid to challenge incumbents.Those campaigns, and the prospect of multiple female candidates, may change how women are treated in the presidential race.“When you have two women running, the question becomes, what are you going to fight for, what do you believe in — not what are you going to do with your children, how do you get your hair to stay like that all day,” said Representative Katie Porter, who defeated a female Republican incumbent to flip her California congressional seat in November.Ms. Lake, the Democratic pollster, pointed to women’s high turnout rates in primaries, and to their success in championing issues like health care and education, which could continue to resonate in a presidential race. Those topics, along with immigration and income inequality, are likely to form the base of a national message for the nominee.And she noted that many of the states with early presidential primaries or caucuses have had women as governors or senators, suggesting that those voters had no reluctance about electing women. These include the former Democratic governor of New Hampshire; Democratic senators in New Hampshire, Nevada and California; the current Republican governor of Iowa; and the former governor of South Carolina.As Democrats prepare for a crowded primary field, there are other considerations that have nothing to do with gender, but rather the party’s divisions over ideology and geography. Some are focusing on reversing Electoral College losses in the Midwest and argue a centrist from the region, male or female, might have broader appeal; others believe only progressives can fire up the party base. Senators Harris, Gillibrand and Warren are based on the coasts and have allied themselves with the party’s left.However gender plays out in this election, many Democrats say it’s impossible to imagine a future presidential field without women who are serious contenders — on both sides of the aisle.“It is more likely than not that you will have women running for president in both parties,” said Kathy Sullivan, a longtime Democratic National Committee member and former state party chairwoman in New Hampshire. “Women will continue to run and at some point, hopefully before my untimely demise, a woman will be elected president.”\",\n",

      "          \"articleBody\": \"WASHINGTON — The Senate Intelligence Committee has issued a subpoena to compel Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, to appear before the panel next month to formally correct false testimony that he delivered last year about a proposed Trump Organization project in Moscow, one of his lawyers confirmed on Thursday.The subpoena was disclosed a day after Mr. Cohen pulled out of a public hearing scheduled for Feb. 7 before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, citing in a letter from his lawyer, Lanny J. Davis, verbal attacks by Mr. Trump.Mr. Cohen’s initial agreement to appear before the Oversight Committee had been voluntary, but he will have little choice in complying with the Senate request. Democrats in charge of the House Oversight and Intelligence committees have signaled in recent days that they may follow suit and issue subpoenas of their own, despite acknowledging Mr. Cohen’s safety concerns.Unlike the Oversight session, Mr. Cohen’s return to the Senate Intelligence Committee will almost certainly be behind closed doors. The panel has conducted a wide-ranging investigation of Russia’s election interference campaign, and possible ties to the Trump campaign, for roughly two years now largely out of the public eye.Mr. Cohen has appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee twice before behind closed doors. In one case, the panel’s leaders abruptly cut short the session after learning that he had shared with reporters a written opening statement he would deliver in private — testimony that would later prove to have contained falsehoods about a Trump Organization proposal to build a skyscraper in Moscow. He was later brought back for a closed-door session with Senate investigators, the details of which have remained secret. (Mr. Cohen also made false statements to the House Intelligence Committee, according to the special counsel.)Since his guilty plea in late November for lying to Congress, Senate Intelligence Committee officials have worked with Mr. Cohen and his lawyers to try to secure a return visit voluntarily so he can correct his false testimony and answer other questions pertinent to the panel’s investigation. But those talks were unproductive, even as Mr. Cohen agreed to appear publicly before another congressional panel.Spokeswomen for the intelligence committee’s top Republican and Democrat both declined to comment, and Mr. Davis did not elaborate beyond confirming receipt of the subpoena, which was first reported by CNN.The back and forth over Mr. Cohen’s testimony was the cause of continued sniping on Thursday between Mr. Trump and Mr. Davis. The president linked Mr. Cohen to his one-time Democratic political rival, Hillary Clinton, a pairing that seemed designed to excite his core voters.In an early morning Twitter post, Mr. Trump described Mr. Cohen as a “bad lawyer” and reminded the public about Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 interview with the F.B.I., the circumstances of which have become part of a litany of anti-Clinton narratives that cast the investigation into her use of a private server as flawed.ImagePresident Trump at the White House on Wednesday.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesThe second lawyer to whom Mr. Trump alludes without naming is most likely Mr.  Davis, a Washington attorney and close ally of the Clintons, who is currently representing Mr. Cohen.In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Davis accused Mr. Trump’s current personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, of witness tampering for recent comments he made about Mr. Cohen’s father-in-law, suggesting he might have ties to organized crime. Earlier this week, Mr. Cohen canceled his plans to testify publicly before Congress next month, citing concerns about his family’s safety.Mr. Trump has previously raised the notion that Mr. Cohen’s father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, a Ukrainian immigrant, has ties to organized crime, but there has been no evidence to back up those claims. Mr. Shusterman pleaded guilty in 1993 of trying to evade federal income reporting requirements and was sentenced to probation.“Mr. Trump has immunity from indictments, so it’s alleged or argued in the Justice Department,” Mr. Davis said on Thursday in an interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America.” “But Mr. Giuliani has committed a crime or at least should be indicted for that crime on the face of what he said on national television.”Mr. Giuliani responded on Thursday, saying that the president’s remarks were “more than sufficient” to answer those claims.Mr. Trump and his advisers had been focused on what Mr. Cohen might have said to Congress that could further damage the president’s image and possibly present new legal problems. Republicans, however, were eager for Mr. Cohen to testify in public, saying privately that they planned to question him aggressively and paint him as a liar.Top House Democrats have already warned Mr. Trump about witness tampering after the president made comments earlier this month accusing Mr. Cohen of lying in an effort to get a better deal with federal prosecutors.On Wednesday, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who leads the Oversight and Reform Committee, and Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said they understood Mr. Cohen’s concerns for his family’s safety and repeated their earlier warning against efforts to intimidate witnesses, which is against the law.Mrs. Clinton, now a private citizen, continues to be a favorite target of Mr. Trump and some of his supporters who have chanted “lock her up” at rallies nearly two years after she lost the presidential election.\",\n",

      "          \"articleBody\": \"COLUMBIA, S.C. — As Senator Kamala Harris attempts her own version of former President Barack Obama’s historic rise from first-term senator to the White House, one of her political tests will be trying to secure the overwhelming support from black voters that buoyed Mr. Obama in 2008. Ms. Harris wants that support, but it does not come automatically.In many ways, she is well positioned: Ms. Harris is the most high-profile and politically connected black woman ever to run for president, and she can also draw on her powerful alumni networks from Howard University, one of the most prominent historically black colleges, and Alpha Kappa Alpha, the oldest black sorority.Yet interviews with more than 30 black voters and political leaders in early primary states like South Carolina and her home state, California, show that Ms. Harris faces challenges. She will have to persuade black activists skeptical of her record as a prosecutor; overcome sexism and a bias on the part of some voters that a female candidate cannot beat President Trump; and work to gain broader support from black men, who generally expressed more wariness about Ms. Harris in interviews than black women.She would also need to win over left-leaning young black voters, some of whom were ultimately disenchanted by Mr. Obama’s presidency and may value political ideology more than racial solidarity.Ms. Harris is aiming to appeal to voters of all races, of course. But black voters are a core constituency of the Democratic Party, and they will be decisive in key primaries like South Carolina’s. The 2020 Democratic field is expected to be crowded and competitive, so an advantage with black voters will be crucial — as Mr. Obama found in 2008. Ms. Harris is not likely to be the only black candidate reaching out to black voters, and several white candidates are sure to make enthusiastic pitches to these voters as well.[Check out the Democratic field with our new candidate tracker.]Ms. Harris has never been in a race where black voters made up such a sizable portion of the electorate, and she is already facing some questions after just her first week as a candidate.“Didn’t she do the three strikes stuff?” asked Tyrone Brown, a 48-year-old Columbia, S.C., resident, as he received a haircut and a shave. He was referring to Ms. Harris’s decision not to endorse a public effort to reduce the prison population by changing California’s punitive “three strikes” sentencing law. “I don’t know, I need to see her devotion to the African-American community.”Across the country in Oakland, Calif., Kijani Edwards, 34, was also wary. “Ten years ago, I was moved by Obama. I was in tears in November of 2008, we all celebrated up and down,” he said.But Mr. Obama did not bring the changes Mr. Edwards expected. “The banks got bailed out,” he said. “Interest rates got raised on the very citizens who bailed them out.”“I’m tired of having the conversation of voting for the lesser of two evils,” he added, referring in part to Ms. Harris.[Read here about Kamala Harris’s kickoff rally.]Ms. Harris has long drawn comparisons to Mr. Obama: Both began their political careers in urban, liberal centers and won Senate seats, becoming two of only 10 black senators in history.Mr. Obama, too, had to win over some black voters: A year before the 2008 Iowa caucuses, polls showed him trailing his main Democratic primary opponent, Hillary Clinton, among black voters. It was not until after Mr. Obama stunned Mrs. Clinton by winning in Iowa, a state dominated by white voters, that black voters began to coalesce around him.ImageMs. Harris officially kicked off her presidential campaign in Oakland, Calif., on Sunday.CreditJim Wilson/The New York TimesMs. Harris starts out with an apparently strong base of support among older black women, the most reliable Democratic voting bloc. Black women’s votes helped propel Mr. Obama to the nomination in 2008 and helped Mrs. Clinton beat back a primary challenge from Senator Bernie Sanders in 2016.Ms. Harris handily won a presidential poll among women of color published in December 2018 by the political group She the People. Ms. Harris’s strategists have also conducted internal polling that they say shows backing from older black women.“Of course, I’m leaning toward us,” said Tammie Coleman, a 56-year-old health care worker in Columbia who was shopping for groceries at Walmart. “But honestly I just want a Democrat. Someone with some sense.”But young black activists have been troubled by what they see as a criminal justice record that undercuts Ms. Harris’s claim to be a civil rights ally. Millennial voters are paying attention: They are more likely to hear about a candidate on social media, where criticism of Ms. Harris’s tenure as a prosecutor has circulated, and their political consciousness has been shaped by the Black Lives Matter movement against police brutality.“Any black person that participates in a system that’s inherently racist, upholds it,” said Charles Lee, a 35-year-old Berkeley, Calif., resident, speaking on the day Ms. Harris announced her presidential run.While critics have decried some of her actions like upholding convictions obtained through official misconduct and opposing statewide standards for body cameras, Ms. Harris has said she worked to change California’s system from within and started programs to divert low-level drug offenders away from prison and into schools and jobs long before other district attorneys were following suit.Criminal justice reform and addressing issues like police brutality are not peripheral issues for the younger generation of black voters, but a litmus test for a candidate, said DeJuana Thompson, founder of the millennials-focused advocacy group Woke Vote, and Cornell Belcher, a political strategist who conducted polling for both Obama campaigns.“I’m going to have some point of caution with anybody who used to be a prosecutor,” said LaTosha Brown, co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, which mobilizes black voters.“The entire system is flawed, the way that people are prosecuted, and the unfairness that black people experience in the court system,” Ms. Brown said.Perceptions of candidates are fluid this early in the campaign, and Ms. Harris has a year to introduce herself to the public and defend her record before voting begins in the 2020 Iowa caucuses. On Monday night at a town hall-style meeting in Des Moines televised on CNN, Ms. Harris drew attention for saying she would be O.K. with eliminating private insurers in an effort to achieve Medicare-for-all.Her campaign, in a statement issued after this article first published online, expressed optimism about her prospects.“She’s only been a candidate for one week and we’ve already seen unprecedented enthusiasm for her candidacy that cuts across demographics, background, income, and region,” said Ian Sams, campaign press secretary. He added that in her entire career, “she has defied expectations at every turn and succeeded.”Ms. Harris is not alone among current and potential 2020 Democrats who may face skepticism from some black voters. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was an architect of the 1994 crime bill that many criminal justice advocates detest, and others, such as Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, have previously taken positions on issues like gun control that are controversial on the left.Political scientists who specialize in studying black voters’ decision-making say Ms. Harris’s presidential candidacy also represents an intriguing case study of how they may weigh race against gender on the national political stage. Research analyzing what black voters do when selecting between male and female black candidates has largely been confined to local races, said Theodore R. Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice.ImageMs. Harris has more than a year to introduce herself to the public and defend her record before the 2020 Iowa caucuses.CreditJim Wilson/The New York TimesIf Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey decides to run, as expected, research suggests he could siphon black male voters from Ms. Harris, Mr. Johnson said. Black men vote for black female candidates in higher numbers than their white male counterparts, he said, but the presence of Mr. Booker could upend that equation.“Party is, by far, the controlling factor in how black folks vote, so if Kamala Harris was against Donald Trump, she doesn’t have to worry about losing black men to Donald Trump any more than Hillary Clinton had to worry about it,” Mr. Johnson said. “But in a primary, if both Booker and Harris are running and both of them have viable candidacies — which is another requirement — then black men are likely to defect from Kamala at a noticeable rate.”“It’s the gender card that helps him with black men,” he said.Gender came up in South Carolina last week, in interviews with black male voters about Ms. Harris in barbershops, on college campuses and at grocery stores. Several used terms — like “strength” and “aggressive” — that political scientists view as code language for questioning women’s leadership.Ms. Harris attracted national attention grilling Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh and Jeff Sessions during Senate hearings, to the point that Mr. Sessions admitted he was “nervous.”“She’s a woman,” said Nathaniel Stewart, a 58-year-old barber. “And we need strong backs right now. I don’t know if she can pull off that type of strength to take on Trump. I’d rather Cory.”Tyrone Hutchinson, 40, said he thought it was time for a woman to become president, but he said some black men with “traditional values” would not support Ms. Harris. Mr. Brown said he preferred Mr. Booker because he did not think Ms. Harris could be “aggressive” enough to “battle with Trump.”James Moore, a 62-year-old truck driver, said while he could vote for a black woman, he would prefer Mr. Booker or Mr. Biden, because he wondered if the country was ready to elect a black woman.“Ms. Harris seems like a decent person,” Mr. Moore said, “but I just don’t think she’d have a chance, and I don’t want to throw away my vote.”But nonwhite women — more than men — represent the core voting base of the Democratic primary and are arguably the most important constituency for any Democratic nominee. At Ms. Harris’s first two public appearances since announcing her candidacy, the Pink Ice Gala in South Carolina and her Oakland kickoff rally Sunday, black, Latina and Asian women turned out in droves to witness the launch of her candidacy.Rozena Harten, of Oakland, said she did not believe Ms. Harris’s candidacy depended on black male support.“I think black women are more involved,” Ms. Harten said. “I’m tired of men.”Tiffany Stevenson, 44, also a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, said she was “really energized” by Ms. Harris’s speech at the Oakland rally. “I think it shows the type of America I think America wants to become.”In 2014, a research paper from the Center for American Progress, a liberal advocacy organization, argued that the main lesson from Mr. Obama’s victory in 2008 was that the Democratic Party needed to invest more in organizing and motivating nonwhite women, and specifically black women.“As their numbers increase and their participation grows, women of color will increasingly have the chance to sway electoral results, influence which candidates run and win, and play a greater role in shaping the policy agenda,” the paper argued.The author of that paper? Maya Harris, then a senior fellow at the organization.Ms. Harris is now the chairwoman for her sister’s presidential campaign.\",\n",

      "          \"articleBody\": \"For a second time in eight days, Senator Bernie Sanders apologized to women on his 2016 presidential campaign, as he seeks to put behind him a series of damaging reports about the mistreatment of female staff members that threatens to undercut another likely White House bid.A political housecleaning appeared underway as well in the Sanders camp: Three top advisers from the 2016 campaign either will not return if Mr. Sanders runs in 2020 or will serve in different roles, according to people close to Mr. Sanders.One of those 2016 advisers, Rich Pelletier, who served as national field director and deputy campaign manager, was let go Thursday from the main volunteer effort trying to draft Mr. Sanders to run in 2020 after The Times reported on accounts that he mishandled concerns about allegations of mistreatment.Mr. Sanders’s two apologies follow several recent articles describing harassment, sexism and gender discrimination in his 2016 campaign, including a report last week in The Times and another on Wednesday night in Politico. Several of his top aides and advisers have been implicated; Jeff Weaver, his campaign manager, has said he would not return in the same role if the Vermont senator runs again.“It appears that as part of our campaign, there were some women who were harassed and mistreated — I thank them from the bottom of my heart for speaking out,” Mr. Sanders said during a scheduled news conference on Thursday about prescription drugs. “What they experienced was absolutely unacceptable and certainly not what a progressive campaign or any campaign should be about.”“When we talk about — and I do all the time — ending sexism and all forms of discrimination, those beliefs cannot just be words. They must be based in day-to-day reality and the work we do, and that was clearly not the case in the 2016 campaign,” he added.Some campaign alumni have requested a meeting with the senator and his campaign leadership team to discuss the treatment of women going forward, with some delegates suggesting he should not run again until he addresses the issue of sexism in his campaign.In a statement posted on Twitter shortly after Thursday’s news conference, Mr. Sanders said: “Clearly we need a cultural revolution in this country to change workplace attitudes and behavior. I intend in every way to be actively involved in that process.”Though Mr. Sanders has not yet announced he is running for president, allegations of harassment, sexism and gender discrimination that have emerged in recent weeks have already threatened to impede a potential 2020 bid.The 2016 runner-up is especially vulnerable on gender-related issues because so many of his top aides were men and some of his most outspoken supporters, derided as “Bernie Bros” by supporters of Hillary Clinton, were often caustic and sexist in their criticism of the Democratic Party’s eventual nominee.The issue is just as acute because of President Trump’s widely criticized derogatory comments about women and the number of female candidates who could also join the 2020 race. Indeed, the reports about sexism in Mr. Sanders’s 2016 campaign have come as his friend and colleague, Senator Elizabeth Warren, has entered the race with the sort of assault on corporate interests and big money in politics that could appeal to Mr. Sanders’s enthusiasts.In the Times article, former staff members described in on-the-record interviews their experiences with sexism, including harassment and pay inequity. They portrayed the insurgent 2016 campaign as disorganized and decentralized, making it hard to report mistreatment.In an interview on CNN last week following the Times report, Mr. Sanders said he was proud of his 2016 campaign and attributed any missteps with staff members to the explosive growth that was sometimes overwhelming.“I certainly apologize to any woman who felt she was not treated appropriately, and of course if I run we will do better the next time,” he said.The group “Organizing for Bernie” said on Thursday that Mr. Pelletier, who was a leader of group, was no longer part of it “in part due to concerns raised about personnel management related to his employment at Bernie 2016.”As Mr. Sanders considers his next steps, he has faced criticism for seemingly surrounding himself with many of the same people who worked on his last campaign, stoking anxiety that little would change should he run again.He still retains some of his support from the last campaign. But with some Democrats who supported him out of antipathy to Mrs. Clinton already drifting away, he can scarcely afford to lose more voters in the lead up to the primary.Mr. Sanders — who is loath to drift from his unrelenting focus on policy issues and for years has grumbled about the press’s focus on what he calls “political gossip” — plainly recognizes that he must show contrition for what took place in 2016.What is less clear is whether he is prepared to take any more steps to comprehensively address the conduct on his campaign. Both of his statements of apology came in response to media questions following detailed articles, and he has done little else to defuse the criticism arising from the issue.And when asked if he knew about the complaints in the interview with CNN last week, he said, “I was a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case” — a curt response that was widely viewed as tone deaf to a sensitive issue.Mr. Sanders’s supporters are somewhat torn, not wanting to be seen as tolerating sexual misconduct but also deeply angry about what they see as unfair treatment of the senator by the news media and mainstream Democrats.Nomiki Konst, one of the most committed 2016 Sanders surrogates who is now running for Public Advocate in New York, said any claims of sexual harassment should be “dealt with immediately” and noted that “it always helps to have more women in leadership.”But Ms. Konst also pointed out that former male aides to Mrs. Clinton and Senator Kamala Harris of California had also been accused of sexual misbehavior, and complained bitterly about what she called “the Bernie Bro smears” that erased Mr. Sanders’s female supporters.“#Metoo is not a political weapon,” she said. “When we start to use the #metoo movement as a political weapon it starts to weaken it.”\",\n",

      "          \"articleBody\": \"WASHINGTON — In Friday’s indictment of Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser to President Trump, the special counsel for the first time revealed evidence of efforts by senior Trump campaign officials to learn how emails and other information that had been hacked by Russia and given to WikiLeaks could damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. The evidence appeared to contradict Mr. Stone’s assertions that he was acting on his own in his attempts to communicate with WikiLeaks. Senior campaign officials asked Mr. Stone to look into WikiLeaks’ plans, and he kept the campaign abreast of what he found out, the indictment said.The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disclosed new details about his investigation into Russia’s 2016 election interference and possible ties to the Trump campaign:The campaign sought to learn how WikiLeaks’ releases might damage Mrs. ClintonThe public has long known that Mr. Stone and his associates had tried to connect with WikiLeaks in the summer of 2016 as Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination. Senior campaign officials dispatched Mr. Stone on that mission, the indictment revealed.In June or July 2016, Mr. Stone told senior campaign aides that he knew that WikiLeaks had documents “whose release would be damaging to the Clinton campaign,” the indictment said. After WikiLeaks released emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee on July 22, 2016, “a senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases” and other information that WikiLeaks had that could hurt Mr. Trump’s opponent in the race, Mrs. Clinton.The Trump campaign officials were interested in learning about the stolen emails and other documents, despite the fact, as the indictment noted, that the Democratic National Committee had publicly blamed the Russian government more than a month earlier for hacking its computers.Someone ‘directed’ a senior Trump campaign aide to contact Mr. StoneThis is the most tantalizing new detail in the indictment. Prosecutors left open the possibility that Mr. Trump himself might have wanted to find out how WikiLeaks could hurt Mrs. Clinton’s chances of winning the White House. The indictment provided no details about either the senior campaign official or the unnamed person.ImageA portion of the indictment.Everyone Who’s Been Charged in Investigations Related to the 2016 ElectionSix Trump advisers or officials have been charged by the special counsel.Jay Sekulow, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, sought to distance his client from the indictment and any suggestion that he might have sought to coordinate with WikiLeaks. “The indictment today does not allege Russian collusion by Roger Stone or anyone else,” Mr. Sekulow said in a statement. “Rather, the indictment focuses on alleged false statements Mr. Stone made to Congress.”It was obvious during the summer of 2016 that Mr. Trump was interested in what WikiLeaks was up to. A day after WikiLeaks released the Democratic committee’s emails, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that the documents showed Democrats were trying to “destroy” Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who was running against Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Mr. Trump directed his Twitter followers to the WikiLeaks disclosures, writing: “On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED.”And a few days later, during a campaign rally, Mr. Trump invited Russia to search for emails Mrs. Clinton had deleted from a private account when she was secretary of state.Mr. Stone is not charged with conspiracyCampaign officials sought information from WikiLeaks, the indictment said, but it did not allege that those interactions were illegal or that Mr. Stone or anyone else tied to the Trump campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the organization.This is a point that lawyers for the White House and Mr. Stone emphasized in response to Mr. Stone’s arrest and the allegations in the indictment. The lawyers said Mr. Stone was not charged with “collusion” — the president’s shorthand for conspiring with the Russians.Mr. Mueller’s team has obtained indictments against Russians for conspiring to defraud the United States through an illegal social media campaign and conspiring to hack Democratic computers to steal emails and other documents. Investigators had been trying to determine whether Mr. Stone or any of Mr. Trump’s other associates were part of any illegal scheme orchestrated by the Russians or WikiLeaks to influence the election, according to two people briefed on the inquiry.To charge a defendant with such a conspiracy, prosecutors would need to show much more than what they allege in Mr. Stone’s indictment. They would have to show the defendant agreed with one or more people to commit a crime and knew the objective of the criminal scheme and took action to further it, said John Marston, a former assistant United States attorney who is now a partner at the law firm Foley Hoag.Prosecutors would not have to prove that the defendant knew every aspect of the conspiracy, Mr. Marston said. “But the government really needs something to show more than that the person was just associating with other bad actors, or merely aware of what the bad actors were doing,” he said.Mr. Stone is the latest Trump associate charged with lyingThe special counsel has charged six other Trump associates on allegations of lying to Congress or federal authorities. Among them were Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser; Michael D. Cohen, the president’s longtime lawyer and fixer; and Rick Gates, the former Trump deputy campaign manager.In May 2017, Mr. Stone falsely told the House Intelligence Committee that he never discussed his WikiLeaks communications with anyone in the Trump campaign, according to the indictment. He also lied when he told the committee that he had no documents of interest to the House investigators, when in fact he had dozens of relevant emails and text messages, prosecutors said.He also falsely denied that he had asked intermediaries to pass along requests to Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, for documents that he believed would hurt Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, according to the indictment.He was also charged with trying to prevent an associate from contradicting his lies in his own testimony to the House committee. “Stonewall it. Plead the fifth,” he texted the associate.\",\n",

      "          \"articleBody\": \"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Saturday unleashed an extended assault on the F.B.I. and the special counsel’s investigation, knitting together a comprehensive alternative story in which he had been framed by disgraced “losers” at the bureau’s highest levels.In a two-hour span starting at 7 a.m., the president made a series of false claims on Twitter about his adversaries and the events surrounding the inquiry. He was responding to a report in The New York Times that, after he fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director in 2017, the bureau began investigating whether the president had acted on behalf of Russia.In his tweets, the president accused Hillary Clinton, without evidence, of breaking the law by lying to the F.B.I. He claimed that Mr. Comey was corrupt and best friends with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. He said Mr. Mueller was employing a team of Democrats — another misleading assertion — bent on taking him down.Individually, the president’s claims were familiar. But as the special counsel’s inquiry edges ever closer to him, Democrats vow a blizzard of investigations of their own and the government shutdown reaches record lengths, Mr. Trump compiled all the threads of the conspiracy theory he has pushed for many months in an effort to discredit the investigation.Hours later, Mr. Trump continued his broadside on a friendly television venue, Jeanine Pirro’s show on Fox News. Asked “are you now or have you ever worked for Russia, Mr. President?” Mr. Trump did not directly answer the question.“I think it’s the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked,” he said by telephone. “I think it’s the most insulting article I’ve ever had written.”He also denied a report in The Washington Post that he had taken extensive steps to conceal from other high-ranking officials his conversations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia over the past two years.Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that his panel would hold hearings on “the mysteries swirling around Trump’s bizarre relationship with Putin and his cronies, and how those dark dealings affect our national security.”ImageJames B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, responded to Mr. Trump with a quotation attributed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt: “I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.”CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesIn his Twitter outburst earlier in the day, Mr. Trump accused the F.B.I. of opening “for no reason” and “with no proof” an investigation in 2017 into whether he had been working against American interests on behalf of Russia, painting his own actions toward Russia as actually “FAR tougher” than those of his predecessors.The Times article, published Friday evening, reported that law enforcement officials became so alarmed by Mr. Trump’s behavior surrounding his firing of Mr. Comey that they took the explosive step of opening a counterintelligence investigation against him.Naming several of the bureau’s now-departed top officials, including Mr. Comey and his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, Mr. Trump said the F.B.I. had “tried to do a number on your President,” accusing the “losers” of essentially fabricating a case. “Part of the Witch Hunt,” he wrote — referring dismissively to the investigation now being overseen by Mr. Mueller.At the time he was fired in May 2017, Mr. Comey had been leading the F.B.I.’s investigation into Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election, and the officials believed that his removal, in hindering the inquiry, posed a possible threat to national security. Their decision to open the case was informed, in part, by two instances in which Mr. Trump tied the firing to the Russia investigation.The inquiry they opened had two aspects, including both the newly disclosed counterintelligence element and a criminal element that has long been publicly known: whether the firing constituted obstruction of justice.When Mr. Mueller was appointed days later, he took over the joint inquiry as part of his larger investigation of Russia’s action in 2016 and whether anyone on the Trump campaign conspired with Moscow. It is not clear whether he is still pursuing the counterintelligence matter, and no public evidence has emerged that Mr. Trump himself secretly conspired with the Russian government or took directions from it.Mr. Trump indicated on Saturday that he had not known of the existence of the counterintelligence investigation before the Times article, and he did not dispute the newspaper’s reporting.But he made clear that he viewed any such inquiry as illegitimate from the start. He presented it, without evidence, as part of a vast, yearslong conspiracy to undo his presidency.In the tweets, Mr. Trump defended his decision to fire Mr. Comey — “a total sleaze!” — at length, accusing the former director of overseeing a “rigged &amp; botched” investigation of Mrs. Clinton, and leading the agency into “complete turmoil.” Democrats and Republicans alike wanted Mr. Comey removed, he said.“My firing of James Comey was a great day for America,” Mr. Trump wrote. “He was a Crooked Cop.”But an investigation conducted by the Justice Department’s inspector general and internal surveys of F.B.I. agents have undercut Mr. Trump’s portrayal of Mr. Comey as corrupt and unpopular within the bureau.ImageAndrew G. McCabe has argued that his firing by Mr. Trump as deputy F.B.I. director was politically motivated and designed to hinder the Russia investigation.CreditPete Marovich/Getty ImagesMr. Trump’s comments echoed those that his White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, released on Friday night.“This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he’s a disgraced partisan hack, and his deputy, Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the F.B.I.,” Ms. Sanders said. “Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia.”Parts of the statements by Mr. Trump and Ms. Sanders are at odds with the public record and with the findings of the inspector general’s report. While Democrats were furious with Mr. Comey over his public statements about the Clinton email server case — at a news conference and in a pair of letters in the middle of the campaign — they were deeply alarmed by his removal, given his role in the Russia investigation.In his report, the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, pointedly criticized Mr. Comey for breaking with longstanding policy to publicly discuss the Clinton case, and he castigated “insubordinate” senior officials who worked with Mr. Comey for privately criticizing Mr. Trump even as they investigated him. But he ultimately said he had found no evidence to believe that the decisions not to charge Mrs. Clinton for her use of a private email server in handling classified information “were affected by bias or other improper considerations.”“Rather, we concluded that they were based on the prosecutor’s assessment of facts, the law and past department practice,” he wrote.Mr. McCabe, who briefly served as acting director after Mr. Comey was removed, was fired last March for failing to be forthcoming with investigators about an unrelated conversation he had authorized between F.B.I. officials and a journalist. Mr. McCabe argued that the firing was politically motivated and designed to hinder the Russia investigation. Other members of Mr. Comey’s team have also been fired or left the bureau.Mr. Comey responded on Twitter on Saturday with a quotation attributed to former President Franklin D. Roosevelt: “I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.”The Times report cited former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation, as well as private testimony that the F.B.I.’s former general counsel, James A. Baker, delivered to Congress related to the inquiry.“Not only would it be an issue of obstructing an investigation, but the obstruction itself would hurt our ability to figure out what the Russians had done, and that is what would be the threat to national security,” Mr. Baker said in his testimony, portions of which were read to The New York Times.Some former law enforcement officials outside the case have since debated whether F.B.I. investigators overreacted in opening the counterintelligence inquiry during a chaotic period after Mr. Comey’s firing. Other former officials noted that those critics were not privy to all of the evidence and argued that sitting on it would have been an abdication of duty.\",\n",
